<p >
The name of the city derives from the village called Sikri which occupied the 
spot before. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavation from 1999-2000
 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before
 Akbar built his capital. It was also a much-loved place of Babur who called it Shukri
 for its lake of water needed for his armies.
 He used it for relaxation and also defeated Rana Sanga on its outskirts.

The khanqah of Sheikh Salim existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son Jaha
ngir was born at the village of Sikri in 1569 and that year Akbar began const
ruction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the bi
rth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and
 imperial palace here. The city came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri, the "City
 of Victory", after Akbar's victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573.
