The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat.
 It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and 
 sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism 
 traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing.
 Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. 
The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century.
